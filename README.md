#Rover Project
 
  We are making a ground  drone that will detect water inside the soil of the plants using two metal prongs stuck in the soil to form a circuit which indicates how much water the soil needs and waters the soil as well. This Drone will take care of the plants to make sure they are healthy enough to send out to people. The reason we are creating this drone Is because we would like learn more about robots and how they work, I will also be working on this project together with Byron Howard. The language we are going to be using will be python 2.
